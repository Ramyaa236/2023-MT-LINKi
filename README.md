MT-LINKi system provides real-time monitoring and control of connected devices through a web interface. 
This tool is used for visualizing and managing data from various sensors or systems that MTI's microcontrollers are interacting with.

**For the MT-LINKi system, I have designed and developed both main and sub screens for the following monitoring functionalities:
1. Cycle Time Manager
2. Anomaly Management
3. Periodic Maintenance
4. Power Monitoring
These screens provide comprehensive monitoring and control capabilities, enhancing the system's efficiency and usability.**


Key features of the MT-LINKi web monitoring screen might include:
1. Real-Time Data Display: View live data from sensors or connected devices.
2. System Status Monitoring: Check the status and health of connected systems.
3. Graphical Representation: Visualize data through graphs, charts, and other visual aids.
4. Alerts and Notifications: Receive notifications or alerts based on predefined conditions or thresholds.
5. Remote Control: Manage or control connected devices remotely through the web interface.
6. Configuration Options: Adjust settings or parameters for the connected devices or system.


This web monitoring capability is essential for managing complex systems, ensuring efficient operation, and enabling quick responses to any issues that arise. 
It provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and controlling systems without needing specialized software or direct access to hardware.
